8. Election of Quaestors of the European Parliament

The President announced that he had received the following nominations for
Quaestors: Mia De Vits, Szabolcs Fazakas, Ingo Friedrich, Astrid Lulling,
Jan Mulder and James Nicholson.

As the number of candidates did not exceed the number of seats to be
filled, the President proposed electing the Quaestors by acclamation under
Rule 12(1), and then holding a ballot to determine their order of
precedence.

The House agreed to the proposal.

The six candidates were elected Quaestors by acclamation.

The President explained the voting procedure.

A secret ballot was held using the electronic voting system.

The President invited the tellers to join him at the President's bench and
then read out the results of the vote:

- Members voting:             669

- Blank or void:    16

- Votes cast:       653

(The list of Members voting is published as an annex to these minutes.)

Votes obtained were as follows, in descending order:

- James Nicholson   334 votes

- Astrid Lulling    298 votes

- Mia De Vits       285 votes

- Ingo Friedrich    280 votes

- Szabolcs Fazakas  267 votes

- Jan Mulder        265 votes

Maria Carlshamre had been present during the vote but technical problems
had meant that her vote had not been recorded.

                                      
                                      

The heads of the EU institutions would be informed of the membership of the
new Bureau.
