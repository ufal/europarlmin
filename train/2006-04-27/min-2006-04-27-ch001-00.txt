1. Opening of sitting

The sitting opened at 9.00.

The following spoke: Antonio Tajani, who paid tribute to the victims of an
attack against a European military convoy that had taken place that morning
in Iraq (the President added her tribute to that of Mr Tajani), and Monica
Frassoni, who objected to a decision taken by the Bureau the previous day
denying the public the opportunity to address the European institutions in
one of their countries' official languages (the President recommended that
she write to the President of Parliament and raise the matter at the
Conference of Presidents).
