3. Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure

The interpretation of Rules 56 and 50 of the Rules of Procedure, which had
been adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs at its meeting of
14 February 2011, had been announced in plenary before voting time the
previous day (minutes of 15.2.2011, item 7).

As it was not contested by a political group or by at least 40 Members
(Rule 211(4)), this interpretation was deemed to have been adopted.

The vote on the report by Vronique Mathieu (A7-0265/2010) was thus removed
from the agenda for the current sitting.
