4. Assignment conferred on a Member

The President announced that he had been notified by the Prime Minister of
the Czech Republic of the decision that had been taken to appoint Jan
Zahradil to represent the Prime Minister during consultations on the Berlin
Declaration, and, more generally, in the context of the relaunch of the
constitutional process during the German Presidency of the EU.

At its meeting of 19 and 20 March 2007, the JURI Committee, to which the
matter had been referred under Rule 4(5), had concluded that the assignment
was compatible with the letter and spirit of the Act concerning the
election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal
suffrage and that as a result it was not incompatible with the office of
Member of the European Parliament. Jan Zahradil could therefore continue to
carry out his mandate as an MEP.
