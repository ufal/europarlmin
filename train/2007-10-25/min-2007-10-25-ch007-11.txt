The following spoke: Gerard Batten, who considered that there was a
difference between the treatment of certain Members, as the President had
cut off Hans-Peter Martin that morning while, according to Mr Batten,
Martin Schulz had been allowed to speak at length the day before (the
President replied that he was chairing the vote in accordance with the
Rules).
