The following spoke: Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, who moved

replied that a majority in the Conference of Presidents had been against
taking such a decision), Francis Wurtz and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, both on
Richard Corbett's remarks, and Richard Corbett once again, who emphasised
the discretionary powers that Rule 156 conferred on the President in
respect of such matters (the President pointed out that his position was in
any case in line with that of the Conference of Presidents, in that he
wished to allow the House to vote on the amendments).
