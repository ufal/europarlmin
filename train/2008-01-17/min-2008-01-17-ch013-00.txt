13. Explanations of vote (continued)

The agenda called for the continuation of the explanations of vote relating
to the day's votes at lunch time.

The President noted that none of the Members who had requested the
opportunity to make oral explanations of vote was present.

Those Members could, if they so wished, submit explanations of vote in
writing.
