1. Opening of sitting

The sitting opened at 9.00.

Kathy Sinnott asked to speak, as the President had not given her the floor
on the first change to the agenda the previous day (request by Martin
Schulz, see Minutes of 12.10.2005, Item 11) despite the fact that Nigel
Farage had asked that she be permitted to give the IND/DEM Group's position
on the request.
The President said that she could take the floor for one minute.
Kathy Sinnott spoke on behalf of the IND/DEM Group.
