12. Order of business

The next item was the order of business.
The final draft agenda for the February I sittings (PE 419.079/PDOJ) had
been distributed and a number of changes had been proposed (Rule 132):

Monday
Martine Roure had withdrawn her request for a short presentation of her
report (A6-0024/2009) on the implementation in the European Union of
Directive 2003/9/EC laying down minimum standards for the reception of
asylum seekers and refugees: visits by the Committee on Civil Liberties
2005-2008 (item 41 on the final draft agenda). The report would be put to
the vote on Thursday.

Tuesday and Wednesday

No changes.
Thursday
Request by the UEN Group to replace the item 'Situation in the Philippines'
(item 58 on the final draft agenda) with an item entitled 'Brazil's refusal
to extradite Cesare Battisti'.

The following spoke: Roberta Angelilli, on behalf of the UEN Group, who
moved the request.

Parliament agreed to the request by electronic vote (104 in favour, 49
against, 8 abstentions).

The order of business was thus established.
