18. Wilderness in Europe (short presentation)

Report on Wilderness in Europe [2008/2210(INI)] - Committee on the
Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Rapporteur: Gyula Hegyi (A6-
0478/2008)

Gyula Hegyi made the presentation.

The following spoke: Viviane Reding (Member of the Commission).

The following spoke: Avril Doyle, who regretted the fact that what she
viewed as an excessive number of reports were subject to the short
presentation procedure under Rule 45(2) rather than being debated (the
President recalled the powers and responsibilities of the Conference of
Presidents and invited the honourable Member to approach the president of
her group).

The item closed.

Vote: minutes of 3.2.2009, item 6.3.
