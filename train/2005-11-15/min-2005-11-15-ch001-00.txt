1. Opening of sitting

The sitting opened at 9.05.

The following spoke: Michael Gahler, who, referring to the strike by
Strasbourg taxi drivers the previous day, objected to the fact that German
taxis were not allowed onto Parliament's forecourt, which he believed
amounted to discrimination (the President replied that Parliament had taken
no such decisions and that the matter would be referred to the relevant
bodies).
