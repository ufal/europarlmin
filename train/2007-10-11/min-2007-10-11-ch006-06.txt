6 6.6. Composition of the European Parliament (vote)

Report on the composition of the European Parliament [2007/2169(INI)] -
Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Co-rapporteurs: Alain Lamassoure and
Adrian Severin (A6-0351/2007)

(Simple majority)

(Voting record: 'Results of votes', Item 6)

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION

Adopted (P6_TA(2007)0429)

The following spoke on the vote:
Before the vote, Adrian Severin (co-rapporteur) clarified a number of terms
used mainly in the amendments by Mauro Zani; Antonio Tajani asked whether
amendment 51 would lapse if amendment 1 were adopted (the President replied
that the matter would be dealt with during the vote), and Mauro Zani
responded to Adrian Severin's remarks.

As the vote had had to be briefly suspended twice for technical reasons
connected with the electronic voting system, Thomas Wise requested that the
vote on amendment 21 be taken again because he considered the result to be
in doubt (the President granted this request) and Vronique De Keyser
suggested moving directly to the vote on subsequent reports on which no
roll-call votes would be taken (the President replied that she could not
interrupt the vote).

Alain Lamassoure (co-rapporteur) made a clarification on the substance of
amendment 1 and the committee's position; Antonio Tajani again raised the
question of whether amendment 51 would lapse if amendment 1 were adopted
(the President confirmed that the former would indeed lapse).
