The sitting opened at 10.05.

The following spoke:

- Giles Chichester (chairman of the ITRE Committee), who sought
confirmation that all the letters of assessment on the Commissioners-
designate had been forwarded to Jos Manuel Barroso, President-elect of the
Commission (the President replied that his question would be forwarded to
the relevant authorities);

- Miguel Angel Martnez Martnez, who asked that Loyola de Palacio (Vice-
President of the Commission) correct certain remarks she had recently made
in the Spanish press that he believed were insulting to several Member

should intervene in the matter (the President replied that he thought the
matter would be dealt with appropriately).
