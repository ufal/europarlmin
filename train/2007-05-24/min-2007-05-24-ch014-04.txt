4 14.4. The situation concerning the President of the World Bank

Motions for resolution B6-0209/2007, B6-0213/2007, B6-0222/2007 and B6-
0230/2007

The following spoke: Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, who
objected to the fact that a fourth debate on human rights, democracy and
the rule of law had been included on the agenda, which he believed to be in
contravention of the Rules of Procedure. He asked for the debate in
question to be withdrawn from the agenda (the President replied that he
would pass on Mr Posselt's remarks to the President of Parliament). John
Bowis, Marios Matsakis, Pervenche Bers and Michael Gahler all spoke on Mr
Posselt's request (the President reminded the House of the relevant
provisions within the Rules and pointed out that the agenda of the House
had been set on Monday with no objections). Bernd Posselt repeated his
request (the President read out Rule 170(1)(2) and noted that no requests
for adjournment of the debate had been made within the set deadlines).

Erik Meijer, Pervenche Bers, Marios Matsakis and Monica Frassoni
introduced motions for resolutions.

The following spoke: Karin Scheele, on behalf of the PSE Group, Gerard
Batten, on behalf of the IND/DEM Group, and Dalia Grybauskait? (Member of
the Commission).

The President returned to the subject of the controversy caused by the
inclusion of the fourth debate on the agenda and stated he would refer the
matter to the President of Parliament in order to prevent such a problem
from happening again in future.
The debate closed.

Vote: Minutes of 24.05.2007, Item 15.4.
