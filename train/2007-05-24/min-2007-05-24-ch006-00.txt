6. Welcome

On behalf of Parliament, the President welcomed Garry Kasparov, who had
taken a seat in the distinguished visitors' gallery.

                                      
                                      

Kyriacos Triantaphyllides called on the President to condemn the previous
day's arrest by the Israeli authorities of several elected Members of the
Palestinian Legislative Council, including a minister in the Abbas
Government (the President replied that he was due to visit the region that
coming Sunday).
