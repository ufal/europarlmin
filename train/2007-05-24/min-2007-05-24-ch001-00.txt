1. Opening of sitting

The sitting opened at 10.00.

The following spoke: Richard Corbett, who pointed out that Luis Herrero-
Tejedor and Michael Henry Nattrass had still not yet updated their
declarations of financial interests even though the fact that they had
failed to do so had already been mentioned several times in the Minutes
(Minutes of 23.04.2007, Item 14, Minutes of 09.05.2007, Item 5 and Minutes
of 21.05.2007, Item 12). He therefore called on the President to take the
appropriate action in line with Annex I, Article 2(5) to the Rules of
Procedure (the President replied that his request would be forwarded to the
President of Parliament).
