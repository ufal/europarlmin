3. Statements by the President

The President condemned the violent attack on the journalist Oleg Kashin in
Moscow during the night of Friday 5 to Saturday 6 November 2010 and
welcomed the fact that Mr Medvedev, the President of the Russian
Federation, had swiftly called for those guilty to be brought to justice.

The President said that on 31 October 2010, for the first time in two
years, a demonstration had been held in Moscow without the police
intervening. He expressed Parliament's hope that this was an indication
that public life in Russia was becoming democratic.

On the same day, Christians in the Syriac Catholic cathedral in Baghdad in
Iraq had been the victims of a terrorist attack. On behalf of Parliament,
the President called for an end to religious violence in the region.

Concerning the award of the Nobel Peace Prize on 10 December 2010, the
President expressed his disapproval of the Chinese authorities' attempts to
put pressure on the European ambassadors, to dissuade them from attending
the ceremony. The European Parliament considered human rights throughout
the world to be inalienable. Parliament would be represented at the
ceremony by the head of the European Union's delegation in Norway.
