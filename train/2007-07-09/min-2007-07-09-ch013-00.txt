Wednesday
- request from the PSE, ALDE and GUE/NGL Groups for the Markov report on
road infrastructure safety management (A6-0221/2007) (Item 17 on the final
draft agenda) to be referred back to committee under Rule 168.
The following spoke: Brian Simpson, on behalf of the PSE Group, who moved
the request.

Parliament agreed to the request.

- no changes

The following spoke: Martin Schulz, who asked for the deadline for tabling
amendments to the 2008 calendar of part-sessions to be extended until
Tuesday, 10.07.2007 at 18.00. The President established that there were no
objections to the request.

                                      
                                      

The order of business was thus established.
