1. Opening of sitting

The sitting opened at 9.05.

Giles Chichester, referring to the remarks he had made the previous day
(Minutes of 15.05.2006, Item 12), asked the President to gain assurance
from the Council that it would be present on Wednesday evening for the
debate on the Energy Community Treaty. If it could not be present, he would
move that the item be deferred until the next part-session (the President
replied that he would bring the matter up with the Council).
