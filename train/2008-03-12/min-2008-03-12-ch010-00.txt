10. Announcement by the President

The President made the following announcement concerning the midday votes:

'For technical reasons, the results of roll-call votes displayed and
announced by the president of the sitting do not correspond exactly to the
actual number recorded by the voting system. In no case has the result of a
vote been affected, as the majorities have not changed.
That being the case, today's midday votes cannot be called into question
and are deemed approved. The results that will be published as an annex to
the minutes of today's sitting will be the actual results.'
N.B.: The same applied to Tuesday's votes, again without affecting the
majorities. The necessary corrections would be made to the numerical
results as soon as possible.
