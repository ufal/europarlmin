15. Order of business

The next item was the order of business.
The final draft agenda for the part-session (September I (PE411.060/PDOJ))
had been distributed. No changes had been proposed.

The following spoke: Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, who
requested that the debate on the social package (item 13 on the final draft
agenda), which appeared on the agenda for Tuesday, be held over to the next
part-session if the debate on the situation in Georgia (item 67 on the
final draft agenda) could not take place on Monday evening as planned but
was held over to Tuesday morning.

Parliament agreed to the request.

The order of business was thus established.
