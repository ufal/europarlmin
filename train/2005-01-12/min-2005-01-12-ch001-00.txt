Evelyne Gebhardt spoke under Rule 28 to ask whether it was true that a
Member had been handed at least one attendance list from December 2004 to
copy, and, if this was the case, what the legal basis for such an action
was (the President replied that the Bureau had looked into the matter and
referred it to the  Legal Service).
