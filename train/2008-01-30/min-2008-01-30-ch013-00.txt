13. Order of business

The next item was the order of business.
The final draft agenda for the January II sittings (PE 401.014/PDOJ) had
been distributed and a number of changes had been proposed (Rule 132):

Sittings of 30.01.2008 and 31.01.2008

Wednesday

- Request by the GUE/NGL group, in agreement with the other groups, to
insert a statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and
Security Policy on the situation in Gaza (this would be inserted as a
second item on the agenda, after the statements by the High Representative
for the Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in Iran (item 2
on the final draft agenda)).

Parliament agreed to the request.

- It had also been requested that the debate on the situation in Gaza be
wound up with the tabling of motions for resolutions.

The following spoke: Francis Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, who
moved the request.

Parliament agreed to the request.

The tabling deadlines were established as follows:

motions for resolution: Wednesday 13 February 2008 at 12.00;

amendments and joint motion for a resolution: Monday 18 February 2008 at
19.00.

The vote would be held on Thursday 21 February 2008.

Thursday

- As the requests for debate on the report by Umberto Guidoni (A6-
0005/2008) (item 6 of the final draft agenda) had been withdrawn, the
report would be taken during the following day's vote, in line with the
procedure laid down in Rule 131.

                                      
                                      

- The sitting would be suspended at 20.30 and not at 20.00.

The order of business was thus established.

The following spoke: Daniel Hannan, on the interpretation of Rule 19(1)
provided by the AFCO Committee (minutes of 30.01.2008, item 12), of which
he called into question the legality (the President replied that he had
decided to refer the question to the AFCO Committee in order not to have to
rule on the matter himself but to take the most democratic option).
