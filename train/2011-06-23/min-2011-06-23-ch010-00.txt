10. Composition of Parliament

The appointment of Stavros Lambrinidis as Foreign Minister in the Greek
Government took effect from 17 June 2011.

Parliament took note of this and, in accordance with Article 7(1) of the
Act concerning the election of the representatives of the European
Parliament by direct universal suffrage and with Rule 4(1) and (4),
established that his seat was vacant with effect from 17 June 2011.

The Greek authorities had announced the election to the European Parliament
of Dimitrios Droutsas to replace Stavros Lambrinidis. In accordance with
Article 4(1), Parliament took note of this, with effect from 22 June 2011.

Under Rule 3(2), until such time as his credentials had been verified or a
ruling had been given on any dispute, and provided that he had previously
made a written declaration stating that he did not hold any office
incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament, Dimitrios
Droutsas would take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and would
enjoy all the rights attaching thereto.
