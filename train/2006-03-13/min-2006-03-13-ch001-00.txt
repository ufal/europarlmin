1. Resumption of session

The sitting opened at 17.05.

Struan Stevenson spoke on reforms concerning the organisation of
Parliament's business currently under discussion in the Conference of
Presidents. He expressed his disappointment that the President had spoken
to the press about his draft proposal without first consulting Members (the
President assured him that Members would be informed in good time and
pointed out that the Conference of Presidents was working on the matter).
Martin Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group, voiced his group's support for
the President's initiative.
