10. Corrections to votes and voting intentions

Corrections to votes and voting intentions appear on the 'Sance en direct'
website under 'Votes'/'Results of votes'/ 'Roll-call votes'. They are
published in hard copy in the 'Result of roll-call votes' annex.
The electronic version on Europarl will be regularly updated for a maximum
of two weeks after the day of the vote concerned.
After the two-week deadline has passed, the list of corrections to votes
and voting intentions will be finalised so that it can be translated and
published in the Official Journal.

Remarks on the organisation of voting time
- James Nicholson (Quaestor), referring to the votes on the reports by Neil
Parish (A6-0038/2007 and A6-0051/2007), called for roll-call votes not to
be taken at the beginning of voting time in future (the President replied
that the two roll-call votes were clearly indicated on the voting lists
that were available to Members).
A number of Members made known their voting intentions in respect of the
roll-call votes on the two reports by Neil Parish (A6-0038/2007 and A6-
0051/2007) (see 'Results of roll-call votes' Annex).
