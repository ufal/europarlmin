7. Announcement by the President

The President pointed out that, at its meeting that morning, the  Conference
of Presidents had voted by a very large majority to express its backing  for
the press release made by the Presidency the  previous  day  concerning  the
withdrawal of Bronis?aw Geremek's  mandate.  He  then  read  out  the  press
release:

'So far the European Parliament has not received any  information  from  the
Polish authorities in relation to Mr Geremek's  mandate.  Mr  Geremek  is  a
political personality of the highest esteem who  has  always  stood  up  for
democracy in his country and for European unification. We will  examine  all
legal possibilities with a view to enabling him to continue his work.
According to our information the Polish Constitutional  Court  is  currently
examining the law on which the withdrawal of the mandate of  Mr  Geremek  is
based. A decision of the Court is expected during the next few weeks.
I have asked the Legal Service of the European  Parliament  to  examine  the
exact legal situation. The Conference of Presidents will discuss the  matter
further at its meeting tomorrow.'

The President added that at that meeting, the Conference of  Presidents  had
expressed its sympathy for and solidarity with Mr Geremek.
