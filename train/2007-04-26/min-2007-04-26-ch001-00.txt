1. Opening of sitting

The sitting opened at 10.00.

The following spoke: Richard Corbett, who pointed out that he, along with
other Members, had tabled a written declaration on the Bureau's reversal of
the complete ban on smoking on Parliament's premises.
The relevant departments and the President had notified him that the
written declaration was inadmissible as it pertained to an internal
Parliament matter. Mr Corbett called for the matter to be referred to the
AFCO Committee in order for that committee to provide an interpretation of
the provisions of the relevant Rule (Rule 116) (the President agreed to
proceed as Mr Corbett suggested).
