6. Statement by the President (Libya)

The President made a statement on the confirmation that day by the Libyan
Supreme Court of the death sentence passed on the five Bulgarian nurses and
the Palestinian doctor held in Libya since February 1999. He expressed
Parliament's solidarity with the prisoners and their families and with
those infected with HIV at the hospital in Benghazi, and emphasised once
again Parliament's opposition to the death penalty.
He called on the Libyan authorities to show clemency and to free the six
prisoners.
