Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the

In accordance with Rule 116(5), written declarations 0017, 0018, 0019,
0020, 0021 and 0022/2008 lapsed as they had not obtained the required
number of signatures.

14. Order of business

The next item was the order of business.
The final draft agenda for the July 2008 sittings (PE 409.330/PDOJ) had
been distributed and a number of changes had been proposed (Rule 132):

Sittings of 07.07.2008 to 10.07.2008

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

- no changes

Thursday

Debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law
(Rule 115):

Request by the PSE Group to remove from the agenda the debate on the
allegation of mass graves in Indian-administered Kashmir (item 76 on the
final draft agenda)

The following spoke: Martin Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group, who moved
the request, and Monica Frassoni, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

At the Verts/ALE Group's request, the President announced that the request
by the PSE Group would be put to a roll-call vote, and Martin Schulz
questioned the admissibility of this procedure (the President replied that
the request for a roll-call vote had been made in accordance with the rules
and was therefore admissible).

After having briefly suspended the sitting, at the request of Martin
Schulz, in order to allow Members to collect their voting cards, the
President put the PSE Group's request to amend the agenda to the vote.

Parliament rejected the request by roll-call vote (72 for, 123 against, 5
abstentions).

The order of business was thus established.

The following spoke: Hannes Swoboda, who called for the Council to attend
the Monday sitting as a rule, and Stavros Lambrinidis, who expressed his
displeasure at the division of speaking time for Thursday morning's debate
on the presentation of the programme of the French presidency.
