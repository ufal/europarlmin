17. Order of business

The next item was the order of business.
The final draft agenda for the November 2008 sittings (PE 415.623/PDOJ) had
been distributed and a number of changes had been proposed (Rule 132):

Monday

- no changes

Tuesday

The PPE-DE withdrew its request for a debate on the recommendation for
second reading by Karin Scheele (A6-0425/2008) on Community statistics on
public health and health and safety at work (item 30 on the final draft
agenda).

The recommendation for second reading by Karin Scheele would therefore be
put to the vote without debate on 19.11.2008 under Rule 131.

Wednesday

Request by the PSE Group to place on the agenda Council and Commission
statements on the situation in the car industry.

The following spoke: Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, who moved
the request.

Parliament agreed to the request.

The debate on the oral question on the review of recommendation 2001/331/EC
providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspection in the Member
States (item 52 on the final draft agenda) was therefore held over to the
sitting of Thursday 20.11.2008 (morning).

Thursday

- no changes

The order of business was thus established.

                                      
                                      

The following spoke: Koenraad Dillen, who, on the basis of Rule 7,
regretted that the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne (A6-0421/2008) was no
longer on that evening's agenda, and asked about the distribution of that
report after its adoption in committee (the President took note).
