4. Statements by the President

To mark the adoption of Written Declaration 0089/2010, the President
expressed Parliament's solidarity with the Czech citizens who, since July
2009, had been required to obtain a visa in order to travel to Canada.

The President stated that 11 March 2011 would mark the seventh European Day
of Remembrance of Victims of Terrorism. He recalled the terrible attacks in
Madrid on 11 March 2004 and in London on 7 July 2005. He denounced
terrorist acts as an attack on democracy.

The President expressed his concern at the reintroduction of the death
penalty in Taiwan, where five people had been executed in 2010. This
constituted a violation of the 2006 moratorium. The European Parliament
asked the Taiwanese authorities to reintroduce the moratorium on the death
penalty.
