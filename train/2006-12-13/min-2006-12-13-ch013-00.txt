The President announced that the report by Jo Leinen, on amendment of Rules
15 and 182(1) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure - Election of Quaestors
and committee bureaux (A6-0464/2006), which was on the agenda for voting
time on Thursday, 14.12.2006 (Item 110 on the agenda), had not been adopted
in committee under the procedure laid down in Rule 131 and would therefore
be included as the last item on the agenda of that day's sitting.

                                      
                                      

The following spoke: Renato Brunetta, who drew the attention of the House
to the behaviour of some security guards at the entrance to the Chamber,
which he deemed to be over the top, and Tadeusz Zwiefka, who expressed his
disappointment that the TV broadcast from the Chamber had been cut off when
the Sakharov Prize was being awarded the previous day, meaning that
Belarusians were not able to watch Alexander Milinkevich's speech (the
President replied that the problems to which both Members had referred were
linked to demonstrations by Parliament's session auxiliary staff).


7. Statement by the President

Personally and on behalf of the House, the President expressed his concern
about the controversial conference on the Holocaust that had taken place in
Tehran on 11 and 12 December 2006 and, on behalf of Parliament, called on
the Iranian Government to make every possible effort to combat anti-
Semitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination.
