10. Corrections to votes and voting intentions

Corrections to votes and voting intentions appear on the 'Sance en direct'
website under 'Votes'/'Results of votes'/ 'Roll-call votes'. They are
published in hard copy in the 'Result of roll-call votes' annex.
The electronic version on Europarl will be regularly updated for a maximum
of two weeks after the day of the vote concerned.
After the two-week deadline has passed, the list of corrections to votes
and voting intentions will be finalised so that it can be translated and
published in the Official Journal.
