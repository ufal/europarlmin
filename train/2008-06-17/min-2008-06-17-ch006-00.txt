6. Composition of political groups

Giuseppe Bova had joined the PSE Group with effect from 17.06.2008.

                                      
                                      

The following spoke: Nigel Farage, who, referring to the President's
statement on the result of the Irish referendum (minutes of 16.06.2008,
item 2), proposed, pursuant to Rule 103(2), that the debate on the Council
and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council after
the Irish referendum (item 44 on the agenda) be wound up with a motion for
a resolution (the President replied that the Conference of Presidents had
already decided that the debate would not be followed by a vote and that Mr
Farage's request had been made after the deadline had expired).
