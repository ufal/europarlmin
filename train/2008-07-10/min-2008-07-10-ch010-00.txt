10. Quorum

The President announced that he had received a request signed by 40 Members
pursuant to Rule 149 to establish the quorum for the three afternoon votes.
Having referred to paragraph 4 of the said Rule, he noted that the Members
who had made the request were not present. He questioned the admissibility
of the request, made in writing, when the Members who had made it were
absent.

The following spoke to clarify their position on the paragraph of the
Rules:  Jo Leinen, chairman of the AFCO Committee, Bernd Posselt, Pierre
Pribetich, Sarah Ludford, Jos Ribeiro e Castro, Ewa Tomaszewska, Esko
Seppnen, Marios Matsakis, Zdzis?aw Zbigniew Podka?ski, Neena Gill, Jo
Leinen and Bernd Posselt on the last speaker's remarks.

The President, having listened to the different opinions, stated that he
intended to follow legal parliamentary precedent as regards the
establishment of the quorum and that before the AFCO Committee (to which
the matter had been referred) had provided its interpretation he would
proceed as follows:

- the debate would take place as planned;

- at the time of the vote he would put the matter to the House to see
whether at least 40 Members supported the request to establish the quorum.
If this was the case, the vote would not take place and the motions for
resolution  would fall (Rule 115(6)); if not, the request would not be
accepted and the votes would take place as normal.
