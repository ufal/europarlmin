14. Agenda

At its meeting of 9 March 2009, the AFET Committee had adopted a motion for
a resolution on the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Sri
Lanka and, in view of the urgency of the situation, had requested that it
be placed on the agenda of the current part-session in line with Rule 91.

The motion for a resolution would be deemed adopted unless at least 40
Members objected in writing before 12.00 the following day, in which case
the motion for a resolution would be placed on the agenda of the current
part-session for debate and vote.
