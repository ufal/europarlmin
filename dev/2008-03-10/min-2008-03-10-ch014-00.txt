14. Order of business

The next item was the order of business.
The final draft agenda for the March 2008 sittings (PE 403.203/PDOJ) had
been distributed and a number of changes had been proposed (Rule 132):

Sittings of 10.03.2008 to 13.03.2008

Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday

- no changes

The following spoke on the agenda for Tuesday: Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of
the PSE Group, who said that Charlie McCreevy would not be present at the
debate on the oral questions on the follow-up after the review of the
'Lamfalussy process' (final draft agenda, item 29) and requested that
Joaqun Almunia stand in for Commissioner McCreevy. Mr Swoboda also asked
for further information on the situation of Franco Frattini, who would
cease to be a Commissioner on 14 March (the President replied that
Commissioner Almunia would certainly be able to attend on Tuesday, and that
the second point raised would be discussed).

Thursday

Debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law
(Rule 115):

Request by the PPE-DE Group to replace the item entitled 'Afghanistan: the
case of the journalist Perwez Kambakhsh' (final draft agenda, item 59) with
an item entitled 'Arrests of demonstrators following the presidential
elections in Russia'

The following spoke: Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, who
moved the request, and Martin Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group.

Parliament agreed to the request by electronic vote (87 in favour, 86
against, 2 abstentions).

The following spoke: Francis Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, who
deplored the outcome and the consequences of this vote (the President
proposed to send a new letter on the subject to the President of
Afghanistan on Parliament's behalf), Martin Schulz, who, on behalf of the
PSE Group, associated himself with Francis Wurtz's remarks and requested
that the item on Russia be added to the debates rather than replacing a
subject, and Bernd Posselt, who expressed his agreement with Martin
Schulz's proposal while expressing the wish that there be five subjects
rather than three.

The President announced that he had received two further requests to add an
item to the debates:
- a request by the ALDE Group and the GUE/NGL Group to add an item entitled
'The case of the Iranian citizen Seyed Mehdi Kazemi';

- a request by the PPE-DE Group to add an item entitled 'The case of
Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho'.

The following spoke: Bernd Posselt and Graham Watson, on behalf of the ALDE
Group.

The President therefore proposed that the subject 'Afghanistan' be retained
and merged with the subject 'Iran' (the request concerning the case of
Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho would fall).

The following spoke: Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group.

Parliament approved the President's proposal.
The debates would appear as follows:
- Armenia
- arrests of demonstrators following the presidential elections in Russia
- the case of the journalist Perwez Kambakhsh and the case of the Iranian
citizen Seyed Mehdi Kazemi.

Sitting of 26.03.2008

- no changes

                                      
                                      

The order of business was thus established.
