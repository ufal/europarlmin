2. Opening of sitting

The sitting opened at 9.00.

Ignasi Guardans Camb objected to the fact that an oral question he had
tabled for Commission Question Time had been ruled inadmissible under Annex
II(A)(3) to the Rules of Procedure. He called for the decision to be
reviewed (the President replied that his request would be considered).
