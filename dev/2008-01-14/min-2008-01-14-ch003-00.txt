3. Approval of Minutes of previous sitting

The following spoke: Sophia in 't Veld, who, referring to the following
day's visit by the Grand Mufti of Syria (Item 18 on the final draft
agenda), questioned the appropriateness of the tendency she perceived on
the part of the Conference of Presidents mainly to invite religious
authorities as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (the
President replied that the Conference of Presidents had approved, by a
large majority, the invitation of the Grand Mufti, but that the list of
guest speakers was not exhaustive), and Monica Frassoni and Sarah Ludford,
who both spoke on the previous speaker's remarks.

                                      
                                      

The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.
