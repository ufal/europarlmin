2. Statements by the President

The President made a statement outlining Parliament's activities over the
coming year. He reiterated Parliament's wish to see the Treaty of Lisbon
enter into force on 01.01.2009 as a priority objective. He referred in
particular to the opening, on 21.12.2007, of the borders of nine Member
States that had acceded to the Union on 01.05.2004, the introduction of the
euro in Malta and Cyprus on 01.01.2008 and the launching of the European
Year of Intercultural Dialogue on 09.01.2008 in Ljubljana.

Recalling the incidents that marked the signing ceremony of the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the EU in Parliament on 12.12.2007 (Minutes of
12.12.2007, Item 4), the President condemned certain Members' conduct on
that occasion and concluded with the following words: 'This occurred in
contravention of the Rules of Procedure and is totally unacceptable. I will
therefore take the measures provided for in the Rules against the Members
who, despite several appeals for order, continued to disrupt the sitting.
The same will apply to the Members who behaved appallingly towards our
ushers, who were simply doing their job.'
