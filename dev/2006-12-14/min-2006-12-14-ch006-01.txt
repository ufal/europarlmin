1 6.1. Draft general budget of the European Union 2007, amended by the
Council (vote)

Draft amendments to the draft general budget, amended by the Council

(Qualified majority)

The President reminded the House of the rules governing the budget vote and
the majorities required. An electronic check of the number of Members
present in the Chamber was taken. There were 542 Members.
James Elles (general rapporteur for the budget), introduced the following
technical adjustments:
'Firstly, Amendment 328 to line 22 02 02 is accepted with + EUR 2 million
for commitments and payments. These EUR 2 million are taken from line 19 05
01. As a result, Amendment 314 to line 19 05 01 is withdrawn.
Secondly, EUR 5 million in commitments and payments is added to line 16 02
02.
Thirdly, EUR 400 000 in commitments and payments is added to line 15 04 47.
With regard to the amounts in reserve which are released: Amendment 302 to
line 16 03 02 - the reserve is lifted; Amendment 251, line 26 01 50 23;
Amendment 330, line 28 01 01.
As regards EPSO, that is Amendment 255: it is replaced by an amendment to
reduce the amounts in reserve to 25% of the appropriations on the relevant
budget lines.
Finally, to take account of a problem on pre-accession assistance which
arose from the Council's reading, and which we were not able to pick up
quickly enough, Parliament calls on the Commission, at the end of paragraph
25 of the resolution, "to present a transfer request or amending budget
during the course of 2007 if the amounts foreseen in the 2007 budget turn
out to be insufficient". This concerns budget line 05 05 01 01.
I recommend that we vote on these particular elements which I have put
forward as technical adjustments.'
Parliament approved these technical adjustments.
(Voting record: 'Results of votes', Item 1)
The amendments adopted are published in the Texts Adopted of that day's
sitting.

Ulla-Maj Wideroos (President-in-Office of the Council) made the following
statement:
'You are about to adopt the 2007 budget at second reading. This is the
first budget for the enlarged European Union of 27 Member States. It is
also the first budget for the 2007-2013 budgetary period. I am pleased to
see that the agreement reached by our two institutions as a result of the
negotiations on 21 November and in the trialogue on 28 November has been
included in the 2007 draft budget.
There are still some minor divergences of interpretation with regard to the
classification of expenditure and the Council reserves its rights in this
connection. Nevertheless, the Council is able to accept the maximum rate of
increase of expenditure resulting from the vote at second reading that has
just been held.
I shall conclude by thanking the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr
Lewandowski, and the rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, for the excellent
way that they have worked with us during the negotiations.'

The President made the following statement:
'I note that the budgetary procedure went ahead in accordance with the
Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, and that,
pursuant to Article 13 of that Agreement, the Council and Parliament have
established that they agree on the maximum rate of increase for non-
compulsory expenditure resulting from Parliament's second reading. The
budgetary procedure can thus be deemed closed and the budget is declared
definitively adopted'.

Having invited the President-in-Office of the Council, Ulla-Maj Wideroos,
the Budget Commissioner Dalia Grybauskait?, the Chairman of the BUDG
Committee Janusz Lewandowski, and the rapporteurs James Elles and Louis
Grech to join him, the President of Parliament, along with the President-in-
Office of the Council, then signed the budget.
