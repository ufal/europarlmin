(Simple majority)

(Voting record: 'Results of votes', Item 1)

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION B6-0526/2006

Rejected

The following spoke:
- Cristiana Muscardini, who announced that the latest version of motion for
a resolution B6-0527/2006/rev. was not available in all languages and that,
pursuant to Rules 136 and 138, the text could not therefore be put to the
vote (the President replied that all language versions were available, and
that the vote could therefore take place);
- Miros?aw Mariusz Piotrowski, who pointed out that during the vote on
motion for a resolution B6-0526/2006, according to the voting list,
amendment 1 should have been put to the vote by a show of hands, rather
than moving directly to an electronic vote, and then having a roll-call
vote on the resolution as a whole;
- Alejo Vidal-Quadras, who supported Miros?aw Mariusz Piotrowski's remarks,
and thought, firstly, that some Members may have been misled by the way in
which the vote had been conducted, and secondly that the latest version of
the text of motion for a resolution B6-0527/2006/rev. contained substantial
changes and that the procedure that had been followed did not comply with
the Rules (the President replied that the vote on amendment 1 had not been
a roll-call vote but an electronic check and that he, the President, was
responsible for applying the Rules);
- Martin Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group, who thought that the Rules had
indeed been complied with and called on the President to press ahead and
put motion for a resolution B6-0527/2006/rev. to the vote;
- Avril Doyle, who drew attention to the potential conflict of interest
involved in the President of Parliament chairing that particular vote;
- Ignasi Guardans Camb, who pointed out that the PSE Group was not the
only signatory to motion for a resolution B6-0527/2006/rev., which in
effect was a joint motion;
- Kathy Sinnott, who pointed out that as a result of the way in which the
vote had been conducted she had not voted as she had intended to;
- Bogdan P?k, who requested that motion for a resolution B6-0526/2006 be
put to the vote again;
- Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who objected strongly to Avril Doyle's comments and
called on the chairman of the PPE-DE Group to give his thoughts on the
matter;
- Jos Ignacio Salafranca Snchez-Neyra, who supported Alejo Vidal-Quadras'
remarks and reminded the House of the provisions of Rule 159(1) and (2);
- Hans-Gert Poettering, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, who emphasised that
the President's integrity was not in doubt at all, although there had been
some confusion at the beginning of the vote; he therefore called on the
President to hold the vote again.
The President said that he would consult the relevant bodies immediately
and then take a decision in accordance with Rule 166(4).
Having consulted the relevant bodies, the President took the following
decision:
- the latest version of motion for a resolution B6-0527/2006/rev. was
available in all languages and was therefore admissible and would be put to
the vote;
- as the vote on motion for a resolution B6-0526/2006 may have led to
mistakes by some Members, the vote would be taken again. It would annul and
replace the previous vote.
