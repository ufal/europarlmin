5. Welcome

On behalf of Parliament, the President welcomed members of a Chilean
delegation - led by Antonio Leal Labrn, President of the Chilean Chamber
of Deputies - who had taken their seats in the distinguished visitors'
gallery.

                                      
                                      

The following spoke:
- Bruno Gollnisch, who pointed out that the Israeli Government had refused
to allow Marine Le Pen to take part in a forthcoming EP delegation visit to
the Middle East. He called on the President to make representations to the
Israeli Government protesting against its action (the President noted his
remarks and pointed out that the Conference of Presidents had decided to
postpone the trip until a later date);
- Carlos Carnero Gonzlez, who pointed out that the voting list he had did
not exist in all languages (the President replied that it was normal
practice for the voting list and that the texts on which Parliament would
be voting were available in all languages, in accordance with the Rules);
- Elmar Brok, Chairman of the AFET Committee, on Bruno Gollnisch's remarks.
