2. Approval of Minutes of previous sitting

The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.

The following spoke: Martin Schulz, Chairman of the PSE Group, in
connection with the ceremony that had taken place in the Chamber early that
afternoon as part of the third 'European Day of Commemoration for the
Victims of Terrorism', which, he thought, had not been the subject of
enough publicity aimed at Members, a number of whom - himself included -
had not been informed of the event (the President replied that the way in
which the event had been organised would be looked into with a view to
increasing its profile next year).

                                      
                                      

Marian Harkin had informed the Chair that she had been present at the
sittings of 02.12.2004, 09.05.2005 and 01.12.2005, but that her name was
missing from the attendance register.
