4. Mandate of a Member

Graham Watson took the floor on behalf of the ALDE Group to point out that
the Polish Government had stripped Bronis?aw Geremek of his mandate as a
Member of the European Parliament with effect from 19.04.2007, as he had
refused to sign a declaration relating to collaboration with the Communist-
era secret services as required by a Polish 'lustration' (monitoring) law,
which had entered into force on 15.03.2007. Graham Watson called on Hans-
Gert Pttering, the President of Parliament, to inform the House as to
whether the matter had been raised at his latest meeting with the Polish
Prime Minister Jaros?aw Kaczy?ski. He also called on the relevant bodies
within Parliament to look into the rules applying to the end of a Member's
term of office and called on Parliament to take action as soon as possible
to protect Mr Geremek's right to exercise his mandate.

The following Members spoke in support of Mr Watson's comments: Martin
Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the
Verts/ALE Group, Francis Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Giuseppe
Gargani (Chairman of the JURI Committee) and Joseph Daul, on behalf of the
PPE-DE Group.

The President pointed out that Parliament had not yet received any formal
notification from the Polish authorities concerning the end of Bronis?aw
Geremek's mandate. He added that the Conference of Presidents and the JURI
Committee would be looking into the matter with a view to upholding
Parliament's independence.
