3. Statement by the President

The President made a statement to mark the International Day against the
Death Penalty, which had also been declared European Day against the Death
Penalty by the Council of Europe. He welcomed to the gallery a group of
Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who had recently been released
after having been sentenced to death in Libya. He reaffirmed that
Parliament and the European Union opposed the death penalty in all its
forms, praised countries such as Rwanda that had recently abolished the
death penalty and encouraged other countries in which the death penalty was
still in force to follow this example.

Parliament observed a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the
death penalty.

                                      
                                      

The following spoke: Daniel Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,
who condemned the attitude of the Russian authorities that had refused to
grant the necessary visas to allow his group and, the previous week, the
Subcommittee on Human Rights to hold meetings in Moscow. He called on the
President to write to the Russian Ambassador and the Russian Government.
(The President agreed to do so.)
